madlib=f'''Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an) {adjective} (adjective) amusement park. It was a 
fun park with lots of cool {plural} (plural noun) 
and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my 
kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the 
{noun} (noun)." We all pushed out in a terrible 
hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and 
we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out 
what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller 
coaster I really liked so, I {adverb} (adverb) ran 
over to get in the long line that had about 
{people_count} (number) people in it. When I finally 
got on the roller coaster I was {verb_past} (past 
tense verb). In fact I was so nervous my two knees 
were knocking together. This was the {adj_est} 
(-est adjective) ride I had ever been on! In about two 
minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. 
Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, 
I was a little {past_verb} (past tense verb) but I 
was proud of myself. The rest of the day went 
{adverb1} (adverb). It was a(n) {adj1} 
(adjective) day at the fun park.'''
